Challenges I Faced
This week, I had trouble setting everything up in GitHub Desktop and figuring out how to open my project in Visual Studio Code. I also didn’t understand how to use external stylesheets at first, but I solved that by finding some more tutorials online and getting examples that showed me how to create folders like style and images. I alson had problems with the github desktop, some changes I saved and made would not commit to my main.

How I Solved Them
I asked for some help from the teacher and i found some more youtube tutorials. Once I understood the folder structure,file linking, and commiting the code to my main things started to click.

What I’m Most Proud Of
I’m proud that I was able to get all my pages working and linked together i think. I also like how my site looks now that I added some custom styles and an image!

How I’m Doing
I'm still learning and getting more confident with each assignment. It can feel overwhelming at times, but I’m making progress.

What I Need From You
Thanks for being patient! Please continue giving examples or checklists for me, they help me stay on track.
